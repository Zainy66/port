          <h1 className='heading'>Hello there! I am Zainab, a front-end developer based in Pakistan</h1>
          <p>
            I have a passion for crafting beautiful web applications. I am a
            third year Computer Science student at Kinnaird College. I am
            also in multiple communities such as IEEE KSB, Web3 Pak, and
            Tech Hierarchy.
          </p>
          <p>
            My adaptability and collaborative nature makes me a quick
            learner who works great in fast-paced environments. I'm eager
            to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a team where I can
            learn, grow, and bring innovative ideas to life.
